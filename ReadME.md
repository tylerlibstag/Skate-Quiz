the idea behind this website was to create a short skate quiz that tested not so well known facts about skateboarding and skate culture.
The questions are stored in arrays and are later called within functions that call arrays within arrays. 
The user clicks the start button to initiate a timer which then prompts them with a question and 4 multiple choice answers. 
Since there are only 4 questions the user has a chancce to get a 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%.
once the user submits their name with the score they recieved they have the option to take the test again by clicking the start button once more.
